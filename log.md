The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log 1

### Day 1: [4th June 2020]

**Today's Progress: I have been learning React , intermediate level for the past few days from Scrimba, and I really find it much easier after practising  on the scrimba platform. Today, I learnt how to do a basic React form, and practised it in my codepen file**

**Thoughts:*Hope, by the end of this challenge, I become a React expert as I love React but sometimes I find it intimidating to do without googling, hehe*

**Link to work:*This is my codepen link to my practice session on React Form, very basic and just a practice stuff based on what I am learning on scrimba. Here is the link : https://codepen.io/meeramenon07/pen/YzymZrQ*
